# Full Stack To-Do App
Hello there! This is repo is an attempt at making a complete app.
This isn't intended to have the polish of a "real world app". My goal is to build out
a simple FE/BE/DB using standard tooling to gain a better understanding

# The Tech Stack

## Front End Stack (TypeScript)
* React
  * Redux, React-Redux, ReduxToolkit

## Back End Stack (Rust)
(WORK IN PROGESS)
* Actix-web
* Diesel (ORM)
* Postgresql or SQlite

# How to run the app
You will need to have npm installed. If you don't have it installed I recommend using
`nvm` to manage your node version.
1. Clone the repo
1. `cd` into client
1. `npm install` to install packages
1. `npm run` to start up the server (should start on `localhost:3000`
